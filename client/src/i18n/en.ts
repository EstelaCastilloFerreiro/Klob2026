    questions: {
      q1: {
        question: "How do I connect my sales data to KLOB?",
        answer: "KLOB offers multiple integration options: you can upload Excel (.xlsx) or CSV files directly, or connect your existing platform like STmoda, Shopify, WooCommerce, and other management systems. Our system automatically detects your data structure and adapts to your columns, even if they're in Spanish.",
      },
      q2: {
        question: "How accurate are the demand predictions?",
        answer: "Our forecasting system achieves up to 90% accuracy (MAPE) for products with sales history. We use an ensemble of advanced algorithms (ML, regression, exponential smoothing) that automatically adjust to fashion seasonality (SS/FW).",
      },
      q3: {
        question: "Do I need to hire technical staff or data analysts?",
        answer: "No. KLOB is designed for teams without technical experience. The platform automatically generates dashboards, predictions, and ready-to-use purchase plans. All AI processing happens in the background, without the need to configure models or write code.",
      },
      q4: {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. All your data is stored encrypted and isolated by client. We comply with enterprise security standards and never share information between clients. Your data is 100% private and only you have access to it.",
      },
      q5: {
        question: "Can I try KLOB before committing?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer personalized demos where you can upload your own historical data and see real results from your business. We also have a trial period so you can evaluate the platform with your team before making a decision.",
      },
      q6: {
        question: "Does KLOB work for brands with few stores or online sales?",
        answer: "Yes, KLOB adapts to both single-store brands and chains with multiple points of sale. We also process e-commerce sales and mixed channels (physical stores + online). The system optimizes its predictions based on your operation's volume and complexity.",
      },
      q7: {
        question: "How much sales history do I need to start?",
        answer: "For basic analytics dashboards, you can start with as little as 1 month of data. For accurate demand predictions, we recommend at least 2 years of history (ideally 2-3 complete SS/FW seasons). The system maximizes the available information and improves its accuracy as you accumulate more data.",
